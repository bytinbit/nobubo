    Creates a collage from digital pattern pages and then chops it up into a desired output layout.
    The collage is assembled according to one or several overview sheets.
    These overviews are usually provided along with the pattern pages in the same pdf.
    If no overview sheet is in the pattern pdf itself, write 0 in the arguments given, e.g. -il 0 8 4.

    In order for Nobubo to run, you need the original pdf pattern.

    Create a backup of the original if you are afraid to have it damaged in any way.

    The author takes no responsibility if you face any fit issues or other problems now or later on.

    Example usage:

    2 overview sheets at page 1 and 34 with differing layouts, which are then assembled to be printed on a0 paper:

    python3 nobubo.py --il 1 8 4 -il 34 7 3 --ol a0 "home/alice/mypattern.pdf" "home/alice/results/test_collage.pdf"
